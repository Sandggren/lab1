        <h1>Academic life</h1>
        <p>In the autumn of 2022 I started my first term of Digital Clutures at Lunds University.
            The program offers a wide array of different subjects like digital marketing, web development,
            graphic design, project planning, audio and film editing.
            I've wanted to learn these practices for a long time.
            Thanks to my studies i've been able to learn the basics of these subjects, but now i seek 
            to develop my understanding of both web development and graphic design even more.
            That's why i have decided to enroll in courses teaching HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            My future goal is to work with and combine these two skills to develop websites.

            <h2>Internship</h2>
            <p>As a part of my bachelor's degree i got the opportunity to do an internship at
                an organization of my choice. The organization where i did my internship is called LU Innovation
                which is an organization that specializes in innovation and start-ups at the university.
                my role at the organization was a communications specialist, i worked side by side with the head of communications
                with several different projects. My main objective was to analyze social media content strategies, while also producing
                content such as images, banners for their different social media accounts.</p>
