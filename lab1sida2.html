        <h1>Academic life</h1>
        <p>In the autumn of 2022 i started my first term of digital clutures at lunds university.
            The program offers a wide array of different subjects like digital marketing, web development,
            graphic desgin, projectplanning, audio and film editing.
            I've wanted to learn these practices for a long time.
            Thanks to my studies i've been able to learn the basics of these subjects, but now i seek
            to develop my understanding of both web development and graphic design even more.
            Thats why i have decided to enroll in courses teaching HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            My future goal is to to work with and combine these two skills to develop websites.

                with several different projects. My main objective was to analyze social media content strategies, while also producing
                content such as images, banners for their different social media accounts.</p>
